This topic describes how to do continuous integration (CI) testing on your tile.

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

There are two ways to do CI testing on your tile:

+ Use the Tile Dashboard provided as service by the Pivotal ISV team.<br>
  See [Use Tile Dashboard CI to Test Your Tile](#dashboard) below.<br>
  This is the method recommended by Pivotal.
+ Set up and use your own Concourse pipeline.<br>
  See [Set Up a Concourse Pipeline and Test Your Tile](#concourse) below.<br>
  This method is more time consuming and not recommended for new partners 
  or partners working on only one tile.

## <a id="dashboard"></a>Use Tile Dashboard CI to Test Your Tile

With your tile in our Tile Dashboard CI testing system, we all win.
You stay on top of changes to PCF that may require changes in your tile.
Our field representatives gain a clear understanding of your tile’s compatibility across PCF versions,
underlying IaaS, and different flavors of environments.
This also relieves you from maintaining your own CI system, keeping up with latest PCF versions, etc.

The Tile Dashboard CI is part of our Enterprise Readiness criteria
which is used to inform the field of the quality and capabilities of your tile,
so it is important to get your tile performing well.
For an introduction to our readiness criteria, see 
[Enterprise Readiness criteria](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z05EuIB11cLejldShVTffprzBulZxiL8MTVxrfPbvT0).

### <a id="tile-dashboard-ci"></a> The Tile Dashboard CI Test Process

The Tile Dashboard CI runs your tile through a series of steps, which include:

1. Downloading your tile from the Pivotal Network and checking hash integrity.

2. Scanning your tile for known issues or potential problems, like:
  - Use of deprecated properties.
  - Use of properties whose values/meanings have changed.
  - Use of features that are no longer supported.

3. Configuring, installing, testing, and uninstalling your tile in several PCF environments:
  - A patch release of every supported Pivotal Application Service and Elastic Runtime minor version.
  - Every supported IaaS
  - Environments with extra configuration, such as multiple availability zones and IPsec

The Tile Dashboard reports the results of each step.
The results reported for each step include a general pass/fail status, the execution log, and output.
If a step fails for a reason unrelated to a tile, such as a network glitch,
you can retry that step from the Tile Dashboard CI.

### <a id="prereq"></a>Prerequisites

Before you use the Tile Dashboard to configure and test your tile, verify the following:

+ You have a Slack account on the PivotalPartners.slack.com organization.
    If you don't have an account, contact the technical program management of the ISV team.

+ You belong to your company's channel in the PivotalPartners.slack.com organization.



+ Your tile uploaded to the Pivotal Network.

    | To upload your tile for a &hellip; | Then&hellip; |
    |------------------------------------|--------------|
    | first release     | contact the technical program management of the ISV team. |
    | subsequent release| you can upload pre-releases to the Pivotal Network.|

 
### <a id="intro"></a> About Configuring a Tile on the Tile Dashboard

After your tile has been uploaded to the Pivotal Network, the Tile Dashboard starts to stage and scan it.
For new tiles, this can take up to an hour.

After the stage and scan, you need to configure your tile on the Tile Dashboard.
Configuration specfies how the tile will be installed.

Configuring your tile through the Tile Dashboard is equivalent to configuring the tile on Ops Manager
after downloading it from the Pivotal Network.

There are two ways that you can configure the tile on the Tile Dashboard:

|  Method | Notes and Restrictions | For more information, see&hellip;  |
| --------| -----------------------| ----------------------------------|
| Through the **Properties** tab | This is a form view of the installation properties. | [Configure Your Tile Using the Properties Tab](#config-with-property-tab) below.|
| Through the **Advanced - JSON Properties** tab | This is the list of properties displayed in JSON. | [Configure Your Tile Using the Advanced - JSON Properties Tab](#config-with-advanced-tab) below.|


### <a id="navigate-to-tile"></a> Log in to the Tile Dashboard and Locate the Configuration Page

To log in to the Tile Dashboard and navigate to the configuration page, do the following: 

1.  Log in to your PivotalPartners.slack.com account.

2. Navigate to the Tile Dashboard URL:
   [tile-dashboard.cfapps.io/static/index.html#/environments](https://tile-dashboard.cfapps.io/static/index.html#/environments).

    ![icons named pie-20, pie-21 and so on in a list](/img/pie-environments.png)

4. Click **Tiles** in the menu bar.<br>

5. Click the row where your tile is listed.

6. If your tile has more than one version, click the one you want to configure.

7. Click **Configure**.

     ![The configure link is in the top left corner under the logo](img/configurelink.png)

### <a id="config-with-property-tab"></a> Configure Your Tile Using the Properties Tab

The **Properties** tab view allows you to configure installation properties through a form.
The form pulls properties from your `tile.yml` file parsing the `properties_blueprints`.
For general information about `properties_blueprints`,
see [Configuration Properties](./reference.html#properties).

In the form, you can configure strings, integers, booleans, dropdowns, selectors,
network addresses, ports, secrets, and simple credentials.
To configure other types, such as nested collections, use the **Advanced - JSON Properties** tab.
See [Configure Your Tile Using the Advanced - JSON Properties Tab](#config-with-advanced-tab).
For a complete list of property types, see [Product Template Reference](product-template-reference.html).

To configure install properties for your tile using the **Properties** tab, do the following:

1. Complete the steps in [Log in to the Tile Dashboard and Locate the Configuration Page](#navigate-to-tile) above. 

2. Click the **Properties** tab.

3. Review or specify the value for each property.

    If a property is required and is missing valid values, the field displays in red.

3. When no fields are red, click **Save** or **Save and Run**.

### <a id="config-with-advanced-tab"></a> Configure Your Tile Using the Advanced - JSON Properties Tab

In the **Advanced - JSON Properties** tab, you configure install properties, specifying them in JSON,
in the format used by the om tool.
For more information about this format,
see [om configure-product]
(https://github.com/pivotal-cf/om/blob/master/docs/configure-product/README.md#configuring-the---product-properties).


To configure install properties for your tile using the **Advanced - JSON Properties** tab, do the following:

1. Complete the steps in [Log in to the Tile Dashboard and Locate the Configuration Page](#navigate-to-tile) above. 

2. Click the **Advanced - JSON Properties** tab.

3. Enter values for all required properties. 

    If a property is required, this is indicated by `"required": true`.

    For example: 

    ```
 ".properties.syslog_selector.enabled.address": {
        "value": "",
        "type": "network_address",
        "required": true
    },
    ```
4. After entering values for properties, delete the required attribute.
   This tells Tile Dashboard that this field is now provided.
    For example:

    ```
 ".properties.syslog_selector.enabled.address": {
        "value": "192.0.2.1", 
        "type": "network_address",
    },
    ```
3.  Click **Save**.

###<a id="uaa-users"></a> Specify UAA Users

Include a list of UAA users for testing your tile.

To specify the UAA users, do the following:

1. If you are not already on the configuration page,
   complete the steps in [Log in to the Tile Dashboard and Locate the Configuration Page](#navigate-to-tile) above. 

1. At the bottom of the configuration page, click **+** to expand 

    ![bottom of page shows plus button used to expand uaa properties form](img/uaa-properties-collapsed.png)

2.  Enter username, password, and groups for UAA user. 

    
###<a id="save-and-run"></a> Save and Run

When the configuration is complete, the config icon shows green. 
At this point, you can test the tile on all the environments, by doing the following:

1. Complete the steps in [Log in to the Tile Dashboard and Locate the Configuration Page](#navigate-to-tile) above.

1. Click **Save and Run**.

    This tests the tile on all the environments.

    ![Success Config save succeeded! Tile CI begun! message appears when the run starts.](img/save-and-run-message.png)

3. Click **Tiles** in the toolbar to return to the tiles view. 

4. Follow the progress of the tests in the Tiles view.

    ![Scan jobs followed by environment jobs.](img/kick-off-testing.png)

    The first three jobs are the scan jobs, done in series. The others are the environment jobs run in parallel.
    The environment jobs do not run until the config job has completed successfully.


### <a id="test"></a> About Test Configuration

After your tile is installed, Tile Dashboard will run any post-deploy errands your tile has defined, including tests.
Ideally your tile will include tests that exercise all of its functionality.
We have some ideas for expanding the Tile Dashboard testing capabilities;
if you’re interested in other ways of defining tests,
contact us on [Pivotal Partners Slack](https://pivotalpartners.slack.com/).

### <a id="backing"></a> About Backing Services

If your tile requires a backing service outside of the existing PCF environment,
for example, your tile is a service broker to a SaaS offering.
You are responsible for maintaining the backing service in an environment
that the Tile Dashboard can reach, that is, it must be internet-facing.

## <a id="concourse"></a> Set Up a Concourse Pipeline and Test Your Tile

The [Tile Dashboard CI](#tile-dashboard-ci) that Pivotal runs for its technical partnership program members
uses the CI tool [Concourse](http://concourse.ci/) to make sure that partner products continue
to work with every new release of the platform.

With more effort, you can also follow the pointers below to set up your own Concourse CI pipeline
that integrates and tests your tile on your own deployment of the latest PCF.

While you are of course also free to use any other CI system you are familiar with,
Pivotal's tools and documentation are built to make Concourse CI as easy as possible.

### <a id="server"></a> Set Up a Concourse Server

You need a Concourse server to host your pipeline.

If you partner with Pivotal,
the [Tile Dashboard CI](#tile-dashboard-ci) servers can host your pipeline
and provide S3 storage to exchange artifacts with your own servers.

If you choose to set up your own Concourse server,
see the instructions [Concourse: Setup & Operations](https://concourse-ci.org/setup-and-operations.html).
 
### <a id="pipeline"></a> Create a Concourse Pipeline for Your Tile

A typical CI pipeline for a tile consists of the following jobs:

- Build the tile
- Deploy it to PCF
- Run a set of deployment tests to verify that it deployed and works correctly
- Remove it from PCF

You describe this pipeline in a `pipeline.yml` file that is then uploaded to the
Concourse server. [Tile Generator](tile-generator.html) contains a sample
pipeline that you can clone for your own tile. We are working on automating
the process of generating a pipeline template for you.
 
### <a id="pool"></a> Set Up PCF for Your CI Pipeline

Pivotal partners who have us host their pipeline have access to a pool of PCF
instances that are managed by us and are regularly updated with the latest
(pre-)release versions of PCF. If you set up your own concourse server, you
will have to target your pipeline at a [PCF instance you have setup](./environments.html).

Concourse has a resource type to manage a pool of resources that are shared
between pipelines, which is what we use to serialize PCF access between the
partner pipelines that run on our concourse server.
