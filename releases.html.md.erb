Learn about the four phases of a product release.

## <a id='alpha'></a>Phase 1: Alpha

A product begins development in the **Alpha** phase. The product goes through constant churn and refactoring, and might not be feature-complete.

Customers do not have exposure to a product during Alpha, and there are no quality requirements in this phase. Instead, developers use this stage for internal testing.

## <a id='closed-beta'></a>Phase 2:  Closed Beta

During **Closed Beta**, a limited pool of users gains access and provides feedback to a product. This feedback drives further development. A status of Closed (Private) Beta informs users that the product might be unstable
and cannot be used in production.

A product can remain in Closed Beta while:

- Changes might break product function or cause loss of data.
- Users might experience major bugs.
- Users might need to delete and reinstall tiles rather than upgrading them.

Developers make products in Closed Beta available to specific groups or individual customers on [VMware Tanzu Network](http://network.pivotal.io).

### Requirements
To enter Closed Beta, a product must meet the following requirements:

* The product must run properly on at least one IaaS, so that customers can install and try it out. Supported infrastructures are AWS, vSphere and OpenStack.

* Customers must be able to install the product error-free through a tile in Ops Manager, and delete the product there without any traces remaining.

* The product tile must target the latest released stemcell version, as listed on [VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells).

* The release notes must make clear the following constraints:

  * Potential data loss and lack of support make the beta version of the product unsuitable for use in production.

  * Users need to delete the old tile and install a new one in order to move to the next version of the product. No upgrade path exists.

* The product must fulfill its promised feature set, and perform as desired.

A Closed Beta product can include an easy way for users to provide feedback to the product developer.

### Steps to release
To create a new Closed Beta release for your product:

1. Log into [VMware Tanzu Network](http://network.pivotal.io).

1. Create a new release for your product and populate all of the required fields.

1. Check that the release version states **BETA**.

1. Clearly state in the release description that the product cannot be upgraded, and that you might experience data loss.

1. Email your <%= vars.company_name %> contact to request product validation and Closed Beta release. Provide basic instructions on how to validate the new feature set. <%= vars.company_name %> verifies that the release meets all requirements, make it accessible to invited customers.

## <a id='public-beta'></a>Phase 3: Public Beta

Your product is available to the general public in **Public Beta**. The wider pool of users increases public awareness and feedback and facilitates marketing and advertising. As development continues, you might publish a series of product versions in Public (Open) Beta.

Your product is a good candidate for the **Public Beta** stage if:

- You have high confidence that further development will not break the product or incur data loss for users.
- The tile might be upgraded at a later date.
- You still want user feedback to discover minor bugs and evaluate existing features.
- The product does not contain the full set of features intended for the final release.
- You feel comfortable supporting this tile for customers.

Products in Public Beta are available on [VMware Tanzu Network](http://network.pivotal.io) to any user with a free VMware Tanzu Network account.

### Requirements
Products in Public Beta must meet the following requirements:

* The product meets all requirements for [**Closed Beta**](#closed-beta).

* The tile can be upgraded to subsequent versions without requiring the customer to uninstall the previous version.

* The product supports upgrade paths from any minor version or patch to the next minor version and any patches.

* Tile version upgrades result in no data or configuration loss, and maintain service functionality and availability.

* Where appropriate, <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> integrations work properly, including:
  * Registered routes
  * UAA
  * Service brokers

* You can respond to discovery of a security flaw on the [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/index.html) within a reasonable time frame. Security flaws include vulnerabilities in your stemcell or within one of the components of your tile. <br>
For more information about the security policy, see [<%= vars.platform_name %> Security Overview and Policy](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/security/process/pcf-security.html).

### Steps to release

1. Log into [VMware Tanzu Network](http://network.pivotal.io).

1. Create a new release for your product and populate all of the required fields.

1. Check that the release version states **BETA**.

1. Email your <%= vars.company_name %> contact to request product validation and Public Beta release. Please provide basic instructions on how to validate the new feature set. <%= vars.company_name %> also validates the upgrade scenario and data persistence. After verifying that the release meets all requirements, <%= vars.company_name %> makes it visible to customers.

## <a id='ga'></a>Phase 4: General availability

A product qualifies for **General Availability** when:

- It is production-ready.

- You can charge money for this product and provide support guarantees to your customers.

- The product's full set of features meets the standards of quality that you wish to uphold.

### Requirements
Products must meet the following requirements for **General Availability**:

* The product meets all requirements for [**Public Beta**](#public-beta).

* You consider the product production-ready, and you have adequate unit and functional tests to ensure high quality.

* You can provide customer support.

* Your business team can "Go to market."

* The product can scale vertically, by increasing the amount of RAM or CPU. Vertical scaling improves performance and does not result in data loss.

* If appropriate, the product can scale horizontally for high availability.
  * Scaled-out nodes (application VMs) function correctly.
  * Removing a node does not result in downtime.

* If appropriate, the product supports zero downtime deployment.

* Product installation does not require an internet connection, after initial product download.

### Steps to release
1. Log into [VMware Tanzu Network](http://network.pivotal.io).

1. Create a new release for your product and populate all of the required fields.
1. Email your <%= vars.company_name %>  contact to request product validation and General Availability release. Please provide basic instructions on how to validate the new feature set. <%= vars.company_name %> also validates the upgrade scenario and data persistence.
