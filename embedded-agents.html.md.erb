You can configure services that use software agents embedded in application containers.

Some service integrations can inject code into application containers.

Examples include:

- Application Performance Monitoring (APM) agents for monitoring services.
- Container-embedded API gateways.
- Client-side routers.

We refer to these injected components as "container-embedded agents."

- [Resources for deploying your buildpacks](./buildpacks.html#other) provide a mechanism to inject components into the application container image, and the `.profile.d` directory provides a way to start agents before or alongside the customer application.
