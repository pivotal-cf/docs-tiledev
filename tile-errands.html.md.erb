title: Using BOSH errands with your tile
owner: Services
---

Life cycle errands are BOSH errands (scripts) that run at the beginning and end of an installed
product's availability time. Product teams create errands as part of a product package,
and a product can only run errands it includes.

In Tanzu Operations Manager v2.0 and later, you can select [co-locate errands](#colocated) on existing VMs.
When errands are not co-located, BOSH deploys a new VM for each errand defined in the tile metadata.
Co-located errands can run alongside other jobs or errands on existing VMs in an operator's deployment.

For more information about BOSH errands, see [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/errands),
and for more information about errands in <%= vars.platform_name %>,
see [Managing errands in Tanzu Operations Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/install-managing_errands.html).

Products can have two kinds of errands.
[Post-deploy errands](#post-deploy) run after a product
installs but before Tanzu Operations Manager makes it available for use.
[Pre-delete errands](#pre-delete) run after you delete a product, but before
Tanzu Operations Manager finishes removing it from use.

To save deployment time, you can set [errand run rules](#run-rules) that dictate if errands run.
Tile authors can [set defaults](./property-template-references.html#top-level) for these run rules.

## <a id="colocated"></a>Define a co-located errand

System tests might incur costs from using third-party services, IaaS resources, and others.

Instead of deploying a new VM for each errand, co-located errands run on an existing VM.
Errands can run alongside other jobs on a VM, and multiple errands are be co-located on the same VM.
Colocated errands run faster than traditional errands and use less resources, including disk and IP space.

To configure a co-located errand, define the following properties in the `pre_delete_errands` and
`post_deploy_errands` sections of the tile metadata:

<table class=“table”>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td width="28%"><code>name: MY-ERRAND</code></td>
    <td>Provide the name of the errand job. The example manifest in the following section uses
      <code>example_colocated_errand</code>.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>colocated: true</code></td>
    <td>Set this value to <code>true</code> to enable colocated errands. If you do not set this value,
      Tanzu Operations Manager ignores all other errand attributes in this section.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>run_default: on</code></td>
    <td>(Optional) You can set the run rules to <code>on</code> or <code>off</code>.
      See <a href="#run-rules">Errand Run Rules</a> for more information.<br><br>
    If you do not define this property, Tanzu Operations Manager sets the run default to <code>on</code>.
    The operator can override this setting using the Tanzu Operations Manager API or the tile's
    <strong>Errand Config</strong> tab.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>instances: []</code></td>
    <td>(Optional) Provide an array that tells BOSH where to run the errand.
    Use the name of an instance group, such as <code>web_server</code>, or a single instance, such as
    <code>web_server/first</code>.<br><br>
    If you do not define this property or you provide an empty array, the errand runs on every
    instance of the job in the operator's deployment.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>label: ERRAND-LABEL</code></td>
    <td>Define the errand name to be shown in the tile's <strong>Errand Config</strong> tab and
      above <strong>Apply Changes</strong>.
    The example manifest in the following section uses <code>colocated errand on web_server</code>.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td><code>description: TEXT</code></td>
    <td>(Optional) Provide a description for the errand that appears in the tile's
      <strong>Errand Config</strong> tab.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td width="30%"><code>impact_warning: TEXT</code></td>
    <td>(Optional) Provide an impact warning that appears in the
      <b>Review Pending Changes</b> tab before running the errand.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

After you define the errand in the sections previous, add the errand to the job properties in the
`job_types` section.

## <a id="colocated-example"></a>Colocated errand example manifest

The following example shows co-located `post_deploy_errands` and `pre_delete_errands` sections
in the tile metadata:

```yaml
post_deploy_errands:
  - name: example-errand
    colocated: false
    impact_warning: "This is an impact warning for your post-deploy errand."
  - name: example_colocated_errand
    colocated: true
    run_default: on
    instances:
      - web_server/first
    label: colocated errand on web_server
    description: This errand does little more than print a message to prove co-located errands work.

pre_delete_errands:
  - name: example-errand
    impact_warning: "This is an impact warning for your pre-delete errand."
  ```

The following example shows the co-located errands referenced within the `job_type`:

```yaml
job_types:
 - name: web_server
    resource_label: Web Server
    templates:
      - name: web_server
        release: example-release
        provides: |
          web_server_info: (( .properties.example_selector.selected_option.parsed_manifest(provides_section) ))
        consumes: |
          web_server_info: (( .properties.example_selector.selected_option.parsed_manifest(consumes_section) ))
      - name: time_logger
        release: example-release
      - name: example_colocated_errand
        release: example-release
    release: example-release
    static_ip: 1
    dynamic_ip: 0
    max_in_flight: 1
```

##<a id='post-deploy'></a>Post-deploy errands

Post-deploy errands run after a product is installed, but before Tanzu Operations Manager makes it
available for use.

Typical post-installation errands include smoke or acceptance tests, database initialization or database
migration, and service broker registration.

Post-deploy errands run by default. You can prevent a post-deploy errand from running by
setting the [run rule](#run-rules) to **Off** under **Pending Changes** in the Tanzu Operations Manager Installation
Dashboard or on the service's **Settings** tab **Errands** pane, before you install the product.

![Here is an example of an Errand.](img/example-errand.png)

For example, Redis has a **Broker Registrar** post-deploy errand that
the <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> tile uses
to register its service broker with the Cloud Controller and publish the service plans.

If you select **Off** from the drop-down menu for Redis's **Broker Registrar** errand
before installation, the Redis service broker is not registered with the Cloud Controller and the
service plans are not made public.

##<a id='pre-delete'></a>Pre-delete errands

Pre-delete errands run after you choose to delete a product, but before Tanzu Operations Manager actually
finishes deleting it.

Typical pre-delete errands include cleanup of application artifacts and service
broker de-registration.

For example, VMware Tanzu SQL [MySQL] has a **Broker Deregistrar** pre-delete errand that:

* Purges the service offering.
* Purges all service instances.
* Purges all application bindings.
* Deletes the service broker from the Cloud Controller.

When you choose to delete the VMware Tanzu SQL [MySQL] product, Tanzu Operations Manager first
runs the **Broker Deregistrar** pre-delete errand, and then deletes the product.

Pre-delete errands run by default. You can prevent a pre-delete errand from running by setting
the [run rule](#run-rules) to **Off** under **Pending Changes** in the Tanzu Operations Manager Installation
Dashboard or on the product tile's **Settings** tab **Errands** pane, before installing the product.

##<a id='run-rules'></a>Errand run rules

Some errands do not always need to run. For example, installing a minor patch to a existing service
might not require re-registering its broker. Tanzu Operations Manager lets you save installation time by
turning errands off or on.

Errand run rules are set in two places:

* **One-Time Rules** under **Pending Changes** in the Tanzu Operations Manager Installation Dashboard. These rules
only apply to the next time you run **Apply Changes** and do not persist after the next successful installation.

    ![Example of Pending Changes](img/pending_changes.png)

* **Persistent Rules** in the tile's **Errands** pane. These rules persist through subsequent
installations, until changed in the **Errands** pane.
