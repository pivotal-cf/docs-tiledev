title: Managing runtime configs for your service tiles
owner: Services
---


You can define and manage named runtime configs with your service tile
for <%= vars.platform_name %>.

You can manage runtime configs in the following ways:

+ Add a new runtime config in an existing product tile. See [Add a Runtime Config](#create).
+ Delete a runtime config from a tile. See [Delete a Runtime Config](#delete).
+ Create a tile that only contains a runtime config. See [Create a Runtime Config-Only Tile](#config-only).

For more information about runtime configs, see
[Director Runtime Config](https://bosh.io/docs/runtime-config.html).

A runtime config is a section of the tile metadata that defines global deployment configurations.
Tile authors can create tiles that only contain a runtime config or add a runtime config to
an existing product tile. When a tile author includes a runtime config as a top-level property in the
tile metadata, BOSH applies the runtime config to every VM in the deployment.

For more information about top-level properties, see
[Top-Level Properties](./property-template-references.html#top-level).

When you apply changes to deployments, Ops Manager combines the runtime config information from every
tile in the deployment and assigns each named runtime config a unique identifier. Ops Manager creates the
identifier using the tile name, a generated GUID, and the runtime config name defined in the metadata.

The identifier follows the following format:

```
TILE_NAME-GUID-RUNTIME_CONFIG_NAME
```

## <a id="create"></a>Add a Runtime Config

Tile authors can add `runtime_configs` as a top-level property in tile metadata. In the runtime config
section, you define configuration properties that Ops Manager applies to all deployments. A tile can
support any number of runtime configs.

A named runtime config, can contain any number of add-ons. Each add-on can contain any number of jobs.

To add a runtime config to a tile, add the following section to the tile metadata:

```
runtime_configs:
  - name: YOUR-RUNTIME-CONFIG
    runtime_config: |
      releases:
      - name: RELEASE
        version: RELEASE-VERSION
      addons:
      - name: YOUR-ADDON-NAME
        jobs:
        - name:YOUR-RUNTIME-CONFIG-JOB
          release: RELEASE
        properties:
          YOUR-PROPERTY:
        ...
```
Where:

* `YOUR-RUNTIME-CONFIG` is the name of the runtime config.
* `RELEASE` is the release used for the runtime config.
* `RELEASE-VERSION` is the version of the release.
* `YOUR-ADDON-NAME` is the name of the add-on that contains the runtime config job.
* `YOUR-RUNTIME-CONFIG-JOB` is the name of the job the runtime config describes.
* `YOUR-PROPERTY` are the properties used in the job.

For more information about runtime config keys, see
[Director Runtime Config](https://bosh.io/docs/runtime-config.html).

For more information about top-level properties in the tile manifest, see
[Top-Level Properties](./property-template-references.html#top-level).

Append your product name or another unique identifier to each of the named items in
the <code>runtime_configs</code> section.</p>

## <a id="delete"></a>Delete a Runtime Config

You can remove an existing runtime config from a tile.
When you upgrade the tile, Ops Manager detects the missing reference and deletes the runtime config.

To delete a runtime config from a tile, remove the `runtime_configs` section from the tile metadata.

For example, to delete a runtime config to a tile you remove the following section:

```
runtime_configs:
  - name: YOUR-RUNTIME-CONFIG
    runtime_config: |
      releases:
      - name: RELEASE
        version: RELEASE-VERSION
      addons:
      - name: YOUR-ADDON-NAME
        jobs:
        - name:YOUR-RUNTIME-CONFIG-JOB
          release: RELEASE
        properties:
          YOUR-PROPERTY:
        ...
```

## <a id="config-only"></a>Create a Runtime Config tile

In Ops Manager, a runtime config tile appears as a tile with minimal configuration options. Runtime config
tiles contain no stemcell, network, availability zone (AZ), or resource config information. You might create a
runtime config tile if you want global deployment configurations to be applied to all VMs in deployment and do
  not any other capability.

For a runtime config tile, tile authors are not required to define the following top-level properties:

* `post_deploy_errands`
* `pre_delete_errands`
* `job_types`

### <a id="example"></a>Example Runtime Config-Only tile

The following example shows a runtime config tile with minimal configuration:

```
---
name: runtime-config-only-example-product
product_version: "3.4"
minimum_version_for_upgrade: "2.0"
metadata_version: "2.0"
label: 'Runtime Config Only Example Product'
description: An example product to demonstrate runtime config features
rank: 1
service_broker: false # Default value
stemcell_criteria:
  os: xenial 97
  version: STEMCELL-VERSION

releases:
  - name: os-conf
    file: os-conf
    version: '15'

post_deploy_errands: []

pre_delete_errands: []

form_types:
  - name: example_form
    label: 'Example form'
    description: 'An example form'
    property_inputs:
      - reference: .properties.example_string
        label: 'Example string'

property_blueprints:
  - name: example_string
    type: string
    configurable: true
    default: Pizza

job_types: []

runtime_configs:
  - name: example-runtime-config
    runtime_config: |
      releases:
      - name: os-conf
        version: 15
      addons:
      - name: login
        jobs:
        - name: login-banner
          release: os-conf
        properties:
          login_banner:
            text: |
              (( .properties.example_string.value )).
```

In the previous runtime config example, the `login-banner` job prints a banner when you log in to any VM in
the deployment. You can use the default value defined in the `form_types` section of the metadata or
configure the banner by editing the **Example string** value in Ops Manager.
