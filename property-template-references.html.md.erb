Here are instructions to help you describes the product template of your tile and how to edit it to include different properties.

The `metadata` subdirectory of a tile contains a product template file in `.yml` format. The product template file specifies how the tile interface collects configurable properties from the user, and how Ops Manager incorporates these properties into its deployment manifest.

You can edit your tile's product template in many different ways. The sections that follow describe what the product template contains and how to edit it to include different properties.


## <a id="product-template"></a> Product template contents

The product template, a `.yml` file in the tile's `metadata` subdirectory, includes or points to:

* **Metadata:** High-level information about your tile.

* **Dependencies:** Specifies tile dependencies.

* **Property blueprints:** Templates to represent values.

* **Form types:** Exposes property blueprints to generated forms.

* **Job types:** Configuration properties for jobs defined in the BOSH release.

* **Runtime configs:** Specifies the manifest for any number of global deployment configurations.

Examples refer to the product template use the [<%= vars.platform_name %> example tile](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/ops-manager-example), a functional tile provided by the Ops Manager engineering team that deploys the NGINX web server.

For more information about product template configuration, see [Top-Level Properties](#top-level).

To learn how to configure your tile's forms, see [Form Properties](#form-properties).


## <a id='property-values'></a> Editing the product template

You can edit the product template to designate property values.

Within the product template, there are two sections with `manifest` snippets:

* `form_types`: This defines the tile interface, or how users of your tile view and interact with different tile features.

* `job_types`: This defines the jobs that the manifest deploys, or what the tile does in response to user input, developer input, or at set intervals.

You can use special expressions in these snippets to include property values that the tile might otherwise not use, such as user-provided configurable properties or dynamically generated system properties.

These special expressions take two forms: double parentheses expressions and triple parentheses expressions.

### <a id="double-parens"></a> Double parentheses Expressions

Double parentheses expressions, such as `(( PROPERTY-VALUE ))`, designate property values that Ops Manager fills in when it generates the deployment manifest. This occurs after the user clicks **Apply Changes**.

These values include configurable properties and properties supplied by Ops Manager.

To include these properties in a manifest snippet, use "double-parens" syntax, which consists of a variable name surrounded by two sets of parentheses, as shown in the following example:

```
manifest: |
  pizza_toppings:
    peppers: (( .properties.example_selector.pizza_option.peppers.value ))
```

### <a id="triple-parens"></a> Triple parentheses expressions

Triple-parentheses expressions, such as `((( PROPERTY-VALUE )))`, designate property values that BOSH supplies when it deploys instances of the tile service. For example, CredHub credentials are designated in triple parentheses.

To include these BOSH deploy-time properties in a manifest snippet, use "triple-parens" notation, as shown in the following example:

```
manifest: |
  credhub:
    concatenated_password: prefix-((( credhub-password )))-suffix
    password: ((( credhub-password )))
```

When Ops Manager parses a product template and BOSH parses a manifest, they both fill in properties designated by double-parens syntax.

Some property values in a product template, such as CredHub credentials, must be filled in by BOSH on the BOSH Director VM, rather than by Ops Manager.

Ops Manager strips the outer parentheses from these expressions and includes the resulting double-parens expressions in the manifest it generates, for BOSH to evaluate at deploy time.

For more information about tile properties, see [Referencing Properties](#property-refs).

### <a id='property-refs'></a> Referencing properties

Each property is represented by two segments:

* The location of the property.
* The information from the property you want to access, commonly known as accessors.

Using these two segments, you can write an expression as:

```
(( PROPERTY-LOCATION.ACCESSOR ))
```

Where:

* `PROPERTY-LOCATION` is the location of the property.
* `ACCESSOR` is the accessor.

#### <a id="property-location"></a> Referencing a location

The method of referencing the location of the property varies. The following table describes the different methods of referencing a property:

| Method Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| .properties.top_level_property | The property blueprint called "top_level_property" found in the global list of properties of the same tile. |
| .job_one.job_level_property | The property blueprint called "job_level_property" found in the list of properties of the job "job_one" of the same tile. |
| job_level_property | The property blueprint called "top_level_property" found in the same tile and job whose manifest is being evaluated. |
| ..other_product.properties.top_level_property | The property blueprint called "top_level_property" found in the global list of properties of the tile "other_product". |
| ..other_product.job_two.job_level_property | The property blueprint called "job_level_property" found in the list of properties of the job "job_one" of the tile "other_product". |

#### <a id="accessor-location"></a> Referencing an accessor

Accessors vary between property blueprint types. The following example uses the property blueprint type `string` with its one accessor, `value`:

```
(( .properties.example-string.value ))
```

Ops Manager allows empty arrays in double-parentheses expressions. For example:

```
(( .properties.example-string.value || [] ))
```

For more information about the available properties and their accessors, see [Property Blueprint Reference](#property-blueprints).

### <a id='product'></a> Product context

Product context is useful for accessing information about a tile. It can be used in a manifest using this syntax:

```
(( ..TILE-NAME.accessor ))
```

Where `TILE-NAME` is the name of the tile.

These are the allowed accessors:

| Accessor | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| deployment_name | Provides the deployment name passed to BOSH for the tile. |
| network_name | Provides the name of the network assigned for the tile. |
| present? | Returns `true` when the tile is staged or deployed |

### <a id='dollar'></a> Dollar contexts

Outside of properties, you can also retrieve information about various configuration details of your tile and Ops Manager.

* **$ops_manager:** Any tile can use this to obtain information about specific Ops Manager deployments.

* **$director:** Any tile can use this to obtain information about the BOSH Director.

* **$runtime:** Any tile can use this to obtain information about the <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> tile.

### <a id='complex'></a> Complex properties: selectors and collections

Most properties are simple values such as strings, integers, URL addresses, or IP addresses. Others are complex, such as selectors or collections.

* **Selectors**: Give the user a choice of a set of inputs.
* **Collections**: Give the user the ability to enter an array of values to create a hash.

![alt-text="Selector showing pizza toppings."](img/selector.png)


![alt-text="Collection showing record collection."](img/collection.png)

The selector and collections inputs are referenced by their selector and collection property blueprints.

Most properties are simple values such as strings, integers, URL addresses, or IP addresses. Selectors and collections are more complicated than simple properties because they contain manifest snippets, which are further referenced in other manifest snippets. Selectors and collections can exist alone, or nest within each other or within different parts of the manifest.


## <a id='top-level'></a> Top-level properties

The exerpt that follows is an example of the properties that appear at the top of a product template. Definitions of each property follow this example.

            (( .properties.example_string.value )).
```

### <a id='top-name'></a> Name

* **Format:** String
* **Type:** Required

The internal name of the tile. You must keep the name of your tile consistent for migrations to function properly. Changing the name indicates the installation of a finished different tile.

### <a id='top-version'></a> product_version

* **Format:** String
* **Type:** Required

The version of the tile.

You can only import this version into Ops Manager once. If you want to import the same tile or version, you must delete the existing one from the `/metadata` folder and delete the installation files from Ops Manager's disk.

The version number is important for migrations. For more information, see [Upgrading Tiles](./tile-upgrades.html).

### <a id='top-min-version'></a> minimum\_version\_for\_upgrade

* **Format:** String
* **Type:** Required

You must set a minimum version for upgrading to your current tile version. This example shows a current tile version of v1.7 that only upgrades from a v1.6.x version of the same tile:

```
- product_version:  1.7.0.0
  minimum_version_for_upgrade:  1.6.0.0
```

### <a id='top-metadata'></a> metadata_version

* **Format:** String
* **Type:** Required

The version of the schema of the product template, the file that this documentation describes.

Bumping the version number activates new properties that are not present in an older `metadata_version` but may also require restructuring of the product template to conform to the new `metadata_version`.

The `metadata_version` corresponds to a major or minor release of Ops Manager. Ops Manager can accept a tile with a `metadata_version` that is older than the Ops Manager version, but Ops Manager cannot accept a tile with a `metadata_version` that is newer than the Ops Manager version. It is therefore best practice to set the `metadata_version` to be the same as the oldest version of Ops Manager that the tile version supports.

### <a id='top-label'></a> Label

* **Format:** String
* **Type:** Optional

The label that appears in the tile when it displays in the Ops Manager Dashboard.

### <a id='top-description'></a> Description

* **Format:** String
* **Type:** Optional

A description of the tile.

### <a id='top-rank'></a> Rank

* **Format:** Integer
* **Type:** Optional

The order in which a tile appears on the dashboard. The BOSH Director always appears at rank 100.

For your tile to appear to the right of BOSH Director, you must set this value to an integer less than 100.  You should set it to 1.

If all tiles have the same rank, Ops Manager sorts them alphabetically.

### <a id='top-pivnet_filename_regex'></a> pivnet_filename_regex

* **Format:** String
* **Type:** Optional

This regular expression allows Ops Manager's VMware Tanzu Network integration to pull a specific tile file. You must do this when there are multiple tiles with the same product slug.

### <a id='top-service-broker'></a> service_broker

* **Format:** Boolean
* **Type:** Optional, default `false`

Set `service_broker` to `true` for on-demand service brokers. Setting `service_broker` to `true`:

* Activates the service network selector property type.

* Requires the operator to select a service network during tile configuration. Tile authors can reference the selected service network with `(( $self.service_network ))`.

* Includes a UAA client for the service to use. Tile authors can reference the UAA client credentials with `(( $self.uaa_client_name ))` and `(( $self.uaa_client_secret ))`.

### <a id='top-stemcell-criteria'></a> stemcell_criteria

* **Format:** Hash
* **Type:** Required

`enable_patch_security_updates` you can automatically use the latest patched version of a stemcell. This key is set to `true` by default. For tiles using static compilations, you can disable this feature. This feature increases security by automatically using the latest patched version of a stemcell. However, operators might experience longer than expected upgrade times.

For example:

```
stemcell_criteria
  os: ubuntu-xenial
  version: "97.0"
  enable_patch_security_updates: false
```

You should set the `enable_patch_security_updates` property to `true`. If you set the property to `false`, your tile does not receive security patches through automatic stemcell updates.

You do not specify which IaaS the stemcell targets. This keeps your product template IaaS agnostic so that one product template can be deployed on any IaaS.

For a list of stemcells, including OS and version, see the [BOSH](https://bosh.io/) website.

For more information, see [Floating Stemcells](http://docs.pivotal.io/platform/customizing/understanding-stemcells.html).

### <a id='top-additional-stemcells-criteria'></a> additional_stemcells_criteria

* **Format:** Array of hashes
* **Type:** Optional

A list of stemcell criteria that can be selected using the `stemcell_selector` property type. These stemcells are listed in addition to the stemcell configured with `stemcell_criteria`. After an operator has selected a stemcell, it becomes required.

For more information about the `stemcell_selector` property type, see [stemcell_selector](#stemcell-selector).

For example:

```
additional_stemcells_criteria:
  - os: ubuntu-xenial
    version: 97.0
    enable_patch_security_updates: false
  - os: windows2016
    version: 1709.1
```

### <a id='top-requires'></a> requires_product_versions

* **Format:** Array of hashes
* **Type:** Optional

A list of tile dependencies. If the required tile is not present in the <%= vars.platform_name %> installation, Ops Manager lists the needed dependencies and does not install your tile until the dependencies are satisfied.

Supported restriction operators are `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, and `~>`.

The following keys are supported:

- `name`: The name of the tile required by your tile. This is a required key.
- `version`: The version range required by your tile. This is a required key.
- `optional`: This is an optional key that defaults to false.

>**Caution**
>It is ignored in earlier versions.
This means that declared dependencies are required in Ops Manager v2.7 and earlier.



For example:

```
 requires_product_versions:
  - name: tile-one
    version: '> 1.2'
  - name: tile-two
    version: '~> 2.3.4'
    optional: true
```

For more information about required and optional dependencies, see [Dependencies](tile-structure.html#dependencies) in _How Tiles Work_.

### <a id='top-release'></a> releases

* **Format:** Array of hashes
* **Type:** Required

The list of releases contained in your tile's releases directory.

The version of the release must be exactly the same as the version contained in the release.

Each release requires the following keys:

* `name`
* `file`
* `version`

### <a id='top-variables'></a> Variables

* **Format:** Array of hashes
* **Type:** Optional

A list of variables, that are generated after a deploy succeeds.

You can reference variables in a manifest snippet using triple-parentheses expressions.

Each release requires the following keys:

* `name`
* `type`

### <a id='top-post-deploy'></a> post_deploy_errands

* **Format:** Array of hashes
* **Type:** Optional

A list of errands that run after a deploy succeeds.

Set the `run_post_deploy_errand_default:` property to `on` or `off` to set the default for the errand's run rule selector in Ops Manager.

For more information, see [Errands](./tile-errands.html). If this property is not supplied, the selector defaults to `On`.

### <a id='top-pre-delete'></a> pre_delete_errands

* **Format:** Array of hashes
* **Type:** Optional

A list of errands that run before a deployment is deleted.

Set the `run_pre_delete_errand_default:` property to `on` or `off` to set the default for the errand's run rule selector in Ops Manager. If you do not specify this property, the selector defaults to `On`.

For more information, see [Errands](./tile-errands.html).

### <a id='top-runtime-configs'></a> runtime_configs

* **Format:** Array of hashes
* **Type:** Optional

These are keys that define global deployment configurations. For more information, see [Managing Runtime Configs](./runtime-config.html).

### <a id='top-verifier'></a> install_time_verifiers

* **Format:** Array of hashes
* **Type:** Optional

Install-time verifiers confirm that properties for external services are set correctly.
Install-time verifiers run in Ops Manager before changes are applied.
Operators can correct invalid properties before deploying.

For example, `Verifiers::MysqlDatabaseVerifier` checks that MySQL database properties are valid by
using the properties to connect to the MySQL database. If the properties are invalid,
the install-time verifier informs the operator.

Each install-time verifier supports the following keys:

* `name`: The type of verifier. The value must be one of the verifiers listed in the table below.

* `properties`: A mapping of verifier inputs to either property references or static values.
The required properties for each verifier are listed in the table that follows.

* `ignorable`: If this key is set to `false`, an operator cannot **Apply Changes** until the verification errors are resolved.
If this key is set to `true`, an operator can ignore the warning message and **Apply Changes**.
This key is set to `false` by default.

* `run_on`: Determines when to run the verifier. Valid values include `'always'` and `'major_or_minor_upgrades'`.
Defaults to `'always'`.

For information about how operators manage and view verifiers,
see [Managing Ops Manager Verifiers](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/customizing/granular-verifier-control.html).

The following table lists the available install-time verifiers:

### <a id='top-icon-image'></a> icon_image

* **Format:** Base64 Image
* **Type:** Required

This is the icon that displays on the tile in the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

### <a id="top-bas-url"></a> base_releases_url

* **Format:** String
* **Type:** Optional

A publicly available URL that is passed to BOSH to download your releases during installation. If you use this text box, BOSH Director must have internet connectivity. This allows you to package your tile without releases, decreasing the tile size.

### <a id="syslog-flag"></a> opsmanager_syslog

* **Format:** Boolean
* **Type:** Optional, default `false`

Set `opsmanager_syslog` to `true` to opt in to the Ops Manager provided syslog form. If you opt in, you do not need provide the Syslog BOSH release for your tile.

For more information about the Syslog BOSH release, see the [Syslog BOSH Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/syslog-release) repository on GitHub.

For more information about migrating an existing form to the Ops Manager provided syslog form, see [Migrating Existing Syslog Configuration to Ops Manager](./migrating-syslog-configuration.html).


## <a id='form-properties'></a> Form properties

Each form type you write is composed of form properties. Form properties dictate the structure of the form text box that appear in the Ops Manager UI. The `name` of each form appears on the left side as navigational tabs.

Form properties reference `property_blueprints`. Property blueprints define each text box's data type. For a corresponding example to the `form_types` example that follows, see [property_blueprints](#property-blueprints).

The following is an example of the properties that appear in the `form_types` section of a product template:

```

### <a id='form-name'></a> Name

* **Format:** String
* **Type:** Required

The internal name of the form.

### <a id='form-label'></a> Label

* **Format:** String
* **Type:** Required

The label of the form as it appears as a link on the left hand side of each form.

### <a id='form-description'></a> Description

* **Format:** String
* **Type:** Optional

The description of the form. Appears at the top of the form as a header.

### <a id='form-markdown'></a> Markdown

* **Format:** Markdown
* **Type:** Optional

Provide a block of markdown to display at the top of the form, including image support. Use this property to document the tile and provide explanations or references.

### <a id='form-property-inputs'></a> property_inputs

* **Format:** Array of hashes
* **Type:** Required

References to properties defined in the `property_blueprints` section of the product template.

### <a id='verifiers'></a> Verifiers

Verifiers confirm that properties are set correctly in forms.
If a verifier displays a warning, the form can still be saved and the warning can be ignored.

Verifiers are similar to install-time verifiers
except that they run after a form is saved and not before **Apply Changes**.
Verifiers do not block deployments and only inform operators that set properties are invalid.

If you want to have a verifier run when a form is saved and before **Apply Changes**,
add the verifier to both the `verifiers` and `install_time_verifiers` sections.

For information about how operators manage and view verifiers,
see [Managing Ops Manager Verifiers](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/customizing/granular-verifier-control.html).

For information about how verifiers are configured, see [install\_time\_verifiers](#top-verifier).

The following is an example of a `verifiers` section:

```
form_types:
  - name: example-form
    label: Configurable Properties
    description: All the properties that you can configure!
    property_inputs:
      - reference: .web_server.example_wildcard_domain
        label: Example wildcard_domain
        description: 'Configure a property of type wildcard_domain'
      - reference: .web_server.static_ips
        label: Example ip_address
        description: 'Configure a property of type ip_address'
    verifiers:
      - name: Verifiers::WildcardDomainVerifier
        properties:
          domain: .web_server.example_wildcard_domain
      - name: Verifiers::StaticIpsVerifier
      - name: Verifiers::MysqlDatabaseVerifier
        properties:
          database: "static-database-name"
          host: .properties.example-database-host
          port: 1234
          username: example-dbuser
```

You can specify either a tile property reference or a static value for a form verifier. In the example above, `Verifiers::MysqlDatabaseVerifier` uses a tile property reference for the database host and static values for the database name, port number, and username.

### <a id='form-placeholder'></a> Placeholder

* **Format:** String
* **Type:** Optional

Specify placeholder text for a text box. The text appears in light gray to show an example value for the user. The text disappears when the user types in the text box and reappears if the user leaves the text box empty.

The `placeholder` attribute displays for the following form types:

* `string`
* `integer`
* `domain`
* `wildcard_domain`
* `string_list`
* `text`
* `ldap_url`
* `email`
* `http_url`
* `ip_address`
* `ip_ranges`
* `network_address_list`
* `network_address`
* `port`


## <a id='job-types'></a> Job types

The following is an example of the `job_types` section that appears in a product template.

This section defines the jobs that end up in a BOSH manifest. Those jobs are defined in your BOSH release.

Jobs require many different settings to function properly. That is the core of what Ops Manager does for you: Ops Manager asks a user to designate values for those settings and generates a manifest based on what the user specifies.

Ops Manager does not require tile authors to provide `vm_credentials` in the `property_blueprints` for each `job_type`. This is because `vm_credentials` are generated automatically. You can find them in the release manifest.

>**Note**
>Ops Manager ignores <code>static_ip</code> and <code>dynamic_ip</code> keys. To configure the static IPs of a <code>job_type</code>, create a property blueprint with <code>name: static_ips</code> and <code>type: ip_ranges</code>.<br><code>static_ips</code> is a special keyword that Ops Manager uses to find static IPs and pass them to the BOSH manifest. For more information about <code>ip_ranges</code>, see <a href="#ip-ranges">ip_ranges</a>.

### <a id='job-name'></a> Name

* **Format:** String
* **Type:** Required

The name of the job as it is to be created in the Ops Manager generated BOSH manifest.

### <a id='job-label'></a> resource_label

* **Format:** String
* **Type:** Required

The label of the job as it is to appear in the resources page of the tile.

### <a id='job-template'></a> Templates

* **Format:** Array of hashes
* **Type:** Required

Each element has the following text boxs:

* `name`
* `release`
* `consumes`
* `provides`

#### <a id='template-name'></a> Name

* **Format:** Name of the job template to use
* **Type:** Required

#### <a id='template-release'></a> Release

* **Format:** Name of the release the template is from
* **Type:** Required

#### <a id='template-consumes'></a> Consumes

* **Format:** YAML string defining BOSH links that this job consumes
* **Type:** Optional

For more information about BOSH links, see [Links](https://bosh.io/docs/links.html) in the BOSH documentation.

#### <a id='template-provides'></a> Provides

* **Format:** YAML string defining BOSH links that this job provides
* **Type:** Optional

For more information about BOSH links, see [Links](https://bosh.io/docs/links.html) in the BOSH documentation.

### <a id='job-release'></a> Release

* **Format:** String
* **Type:** Required

The name of the BOSH release contained in your tile archive, which is the `.pivotal` file.

### <a id='job-single-az'></a> single_az_only

* **Format:** Boolean
* **Type:** Required

You can give users control of balancing jobs across availability zones (AZs) by setting `single_az_only` to `false`.

To limit a job to a single AZ, set `single_az_only` to `true`.

>**Caution** If you change the <code>single_az_only</code> setting, your VMs may switch AZs. This change can cause an orphaned disk.



### <a id='job-max-in-flight'></a> max_in_flight

* **Format:** Integer
* **Type:** Required

A BOSH setting that controls the number of instances of this job that BOSH deploys in parallel.

### <a id='job-use-stemcell'></a> use_stemcell

* **Format:** String
* **Type:** Optional

The stemcell operating system for this job. You must set `use_stemcell` to the value of an `os` key configured in `stemcell_criteria` or `additional_stemcell_criteria`.

You can configure `use_stemcell` to activate jobs to run on different operating systems. For example, you can configure one job to run on Linux and configure a different job to run on Windows. If the instance count of a job is `0`, the configured stemcell operating system is not required to deploy the tile.

If a job does not have a `use_stemcell` property, the job uses the stemcell operating system configured in `stemcell_criteria`. For more information, see [stemcell\_criteria](#top-stemcell-criteria) and [additional\_stemcell\_criteria](#top-additional-stemcells-criteria).

### <a id='job-resource-def'></a> resource_definitions

* **Format:** Array of hashes
* **Type:** Required

A set of resource settings for the job with maximum and minimum constraints, defaults, and configurability.

The resources you can set are:

* `ram`
* `ephemeral_disk`
* `persistent_disk`
* `cpu`

For examples of supported constraint types, see [integer](#integer).

>**Note**
>If you set the <code>default</code> property for <code>persistent_disk</code> to <code>0</code>, users cannot edit this value and the <strong>Resource Config</strong> pane in the Ops Manager tile displays <strong>None</strong> under the persistent disk text box.

### <a id='job-instance-def'></a> instance_definition

* **Format:** Hash
* **Type:** Required

The number of default instances for a job, including maximum, minimum, odd, and the ability to decrease sizing after deploy.

If your tile uses an external service that performs the same job as a service in <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, you can reduce resource uses by setting the instance count of a job to `0` with the `zero_if` property.

When `zero_if` is not active for an instance group, you cannot set the instance count to 0. You can override this by setting `allow_manual_selection_of_zero` to `true`. By default, it is set to `false`.

For example, your tile uses Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) instead of MySQL, which is the default system database for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. Remove all instance counts of MySQL by setting `property reference` to `.properties.system.database` and `property value` to `magic value`.

For examples of supported constraint types, see [integer](#integer).

>**Note**
>If you are using the <code>zero_if</code> property, you should not set the <code>may_only_increase</code> constraint to <code>true</code>.


### <a id='job-manifest'></a> Manifest

* **Format:** Text snippet, prefaced by pipe symbol: `|`
* **Type:** Optional

Ops Manager generates a BOSH manifest that defines properties for each job the manifest deploys. Some of these properties are not set until the user clicks **Apply Changes**, because the user configures them in the tile or because Ops Manager has to generate them.

For more information about referencing these properties, see [Referencing Properties](#property-refs).

#### <a id='job-accessors'></a> Job sccessors

The table that describes the double parentheses expressions Ops Manager provides to access information about the jobs that the manifest deploys:

| Double Parentheses Expression | Description |

## <a id='property-blueprints'></a> Property blueprint reference

### <a id='common-attributes'></a> Common property blueprint attributes

All property blueprints can have the following attributes:

* `name`: Required. The name of the property. The name is used to reference a property in `form_types` and in `(( ))` accessors.

* `type`: Required. The type of property. Must be one of the property types listed in this topic.

* `optional`: Optional. Default: `false`. When set to `true`, Ops Manager does not require this property to be set todeploy, nor does it validate that this text box has a value when saving a form with this property. `optional` cannot be set to `true` if a `default` value is set. For more information about which types support `default`, see [All Property Blueprint Types](#all-property-types). `optional` cannot be set to `true` if the property also has `configurable: false`.

* `configurable`: Optional. Default: `false`. When set to `true` for property types that support operator configuration, the operator is not allowed to configure this value. Do not set `configurable: true` for property types that do not support operator configuration. When set to `false`, Ops Manager does not render this property in any form, even if it is specified in a `form_type`, nor does it allow the property to be updated via the API. For property types that support auto-generation of values, when `configurable` is set to `false`, Ops Manager generates and saves a value for this property when the tile this property belongs to is deployed for the first time.

* `freeze_on_deploy`: Optional. Default: `false`. When set to `true`, Ops Manager does not allow this property to be changed after the tile this property belongs to is successfully deployed.

* `conditional_default`: Optional. Accepts two nested keys: `dependency_present` and `value`. The `conditional_default` key overrides the default value specified in the property blueprint only when that tile dependency is present. Otherwise, the default value is used. The `conditional_default` key is evaluated when the specified tile dependency is imported. It is reevaluated only when that tile dependency is staged or deleted. For example:

    ```
    - name: example_selector
      type: selector
      default: Yes
      conditional_default:
        dependency_present: cf
        value: No
      option_templates:
        - name: yes_option
          select_value: Yes
          named_manifests:
            - name: my_snippet
              manifest: |
                ...
        - name: no_option
          select_value: No
          named_manifests:
            - name: my_other_snippet
              manifest: |
                ...
    ```

### <a id='configurable-and-auto-generated'></a> Configurable and auto-generated properties

When a property has `configurable: true` and is added to a `form_type`, the operator can configure the value of that property.

Alternatively, a property with `configurable: false` gets a value auto-generated by Ops Manager. For which property types support each of these usings, see the sections that follow.

Properties with `configurable` set to `false`:

* Cannot be edited by the operator.
* Do not show up in forms, even if added under `form_types`.
* Get auto-generated values filled in by Ops Manager if that specific type of property supports auto-generation of values.

### <a id='named-manifest'></a> named_manifest for selector and collection type properties

Specify a property for collection within the `named_manifest` section of the metadata, as in the example that follows:

```
- name: certificate_collection
  type: collection
  configurable: true
  property_blueprints:
    - name: some_cert_name
      type: string
    - name: some_cert
      type: rsa_cert_credentials
  named_manifests:
  - name: for_routing
    manifest: |
      name:  (( current_record.some_cert_name.value ))
      private_key:  (( current_record.some_cert.private_key_pem ))
      public_key:  (( current_record.some_cert.public_key_pem ))
      certificate: (( current_record.some_cert.cert_pem ))
```

Use the `current_record` property within a collection record to refer to other properties in the same record.

For example, the properties in the `for_routing` named manifest refer to the values for `name`, `private_key`, `public_key`, and `certificate` within this record only.

>**Note**
>If you are using the The <code>current_record</code> property is reserved. You cannot create a new property named <code>current_record</code>.

After defining a named manifest, you can reference it using a manifest snippet in the following format:

```
routing_certificates: (( .properties.certificate_collection.parsed_manifest(for_routing) ))
```

Ops Manager renders the following manifest from this example:

```
routing_certificates:
  - name: foo_cert
    private_key: PRIVATE-KEY
    public_key: PUBLIC-KEY
    certificate: CERTIFICATE
  - name: bar_cert
    private_key: PRIVATE-KEY
    public_key: PUBLIC-KEY
    certificate: CERTIFICATE
```

For more information, see [Selector and Collection Types](#complex).
