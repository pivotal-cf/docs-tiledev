Learn about the resources that can help you publish and update your service
tile for <%= vars.platform_name %>.

## <a id="publish"></a> Publish your tile

The [Partner software product release cycle](./releases.html) explains how <%= vars.company_name %> works with partners to release VMware Tanzu products,
from the private alpha and closed beta phases, to general availability and publication on [VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/).

After you have packaged your product's BOSH releases, stemcell, metadata, and other tile components into a single zipped download file, post it to VMware Tanzu Network in one of two ways:

  * Use the VMware Tanzu Network
  [API command](https://docs.vmware.com/en/API-portal-for-VMware-Tanzu/index.html) `POST /api/v2/products/:product_slug/product_files`.
  * Use the VMware Tanzu Network product upload form.

## <a id="update"></a> Update your tile

Most tile updates originate with the tile developer, but new releases of <%= vars.platform_name %> can also necessitate tile changes
to maintain compatibility with the current version of the platform.

* Tile Generator automates tile versioning and upgrades.
For more information, see [Versioning](./tile-generator.html#versioning) in the Tile Generator documentation.

* [Tile Upgrades](./tile-upgrades.html) explains how to write and include a JavaScript file that automates tile upgrades
by migrating property names and values from one tile version to another.

* When changes to <%= vars.platform_name %> require tile changes, VMware distributes instructions to all of its partners through the Partners Release Notice:
    * [<%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 Partners Release Notice](release-notes.html)
