<%= vars.company_name %> empowers Tanzu ecosystem partners to self-host product documentation in their preferred format and using their own branding standards. For partners, this has a number of benefits:

* You can organize documentation and navigational experiences as you see fit, with any relevant corporate branding preferences.
* You are not constrained by the time required to coordinate and update product documentation with <%= vars.company_name %> Partner Support.

As a partner developing a service tile, you can specify the URL for your product release notes (hosted on your product documentation website) on [VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com).
