You can document your service tile for <%= vars.platform_name %>.

When a VMware Tanzu service tile starts on [VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io), <%= vars.company_name %> publishes
corresponding documentation under [Partner Services for VMware Tanzu](https://docs.pivotal.io).

This documentation is formatted in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), stored in a GitHub repository that <%= vars.company_name %> creates, and is published with the [bookbinder](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/bookbinder) platform.


## <a id="template"></a> Partner documentation template

The [Partner Documentation Template](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-partners-template) is a GitHub repository
that you can clone to create documentation for your service tile that follows the standard format for partner documentation.
The template works with the documentation publishing platform, [bookbinder](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/bookbinder).

Documentation content resides in the `/docs-content` folder of the repository, as skeleton pages with embedded prompts for content that you should fill in, approximately following the [content descriptions](#content) below.

See the repository [README.md](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-partners-template/blob/master/README.md) for how to use the template with bookbinder to develop your documentation.


## <a id="content"></a> Documentation content

While the specifics of your documentation might vary depending on the product, VMware provides a
basic blueprint. At minimum, documentation includes #1 (Overview) and #2 (Installing/Configuring).

For a good example of a partner service document, see the [JFrog Artifactory documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/jfrog/index.html).

If you have questions or want to collaborate on drafting the documentation, go to the #tanzu-docs Slack channel.

### <a id="index"></a> Index/Landing page

This page provides a general overview of Partner Product. What does it do? What are its features?

Key Features

- Feature one
- Feature two
- Feature three

#### <a id='partner-service-broker'></a> Partner Service Broker

A Service Broker allows Cloud Foundry applications to bind to services and
consume the services from App Manager UI or command line. The Partner Service Broker uses one or more Partner accounts and is deployed as a
Java Application on Cloud Foundry. The Broker exposes the Partner service on the
Cloud Foundry Marketplace and allows you to directly create a service instance and bind it to your
applications either from the Apps Manager Console or from the command line.

The Tile for Partner installs the Partner Service Broker as an application and registers it as a
Service Broker on Cloud Foundry and exposes the service plans on the Marketplace.  This makes the
installation and subsequent use of Partner on your Cloud Foundry applications simple and easy.

If a trial license is available, customers that are interested in using Partner can obtain a
60-day free trial license.
